# Diabetes Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting diabetes based on various health indicators. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building with hyperparameter tuning.

## Repository Description
This repository provides an end-to-end solution for predicting diabetes. It uses a dataset of health metrics, performs detailed exploratory data analysis, and trains machine learning models to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic. The project demonstrates key concepts such as feature engineering, data balancing, and hyperparameter optimization.

## Installation and Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
  - imbalanced-learn
  - warnings

You can install the dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The project uses the `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv` dataset. This dataset contains the following features:

- `age`
- `bmi`
- `HbA1c_level`
- `blood_glucose_level`
- `hypertension`
- `heart_disease`
- `gender`
- Target: `diabetes`

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading:** Load and inspect the dataset for initial exploration.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize correlations, distributions, and feature importance.
4. **Feature Engineering:** One-hot encode categorical variables and scale numerical features.
5. **Data Balancing:** Apply SMOTE and undersampling to address class imbalance.
6. **Model Building:** Train models using a pipeline and optimize with GridSearchCV.
7. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy and classification report.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved:
- **Accuracy:** X%
- **Precision:** Y%
- **Recall:** Z%

Details of the model and its hyperparameters can be found in the notebook.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
